Gameframer KSP
==============
This is a mod that works with services at gameframer.com. 

This mod depends heavily on Gameframer's servers. This connection needs to be authorized 
with an API key defined in Credentials.cs. Please contact me (blaine@gameframer.com) 
if are interested in developing the mod against live test servers.

Note: This source code is a mess right now as it is a combination of me learning both C# 
and Unity programming.
